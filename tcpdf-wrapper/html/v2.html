<p>We are pleased to offer to you the following terms and conditions relating to your employment with [USER_COMPANY] (the 'Company'), which terms shall be effective as of [DATE]. We believe it is important that the terms and conditions of your employment be set forth clearly and completely in one place. That is the purpose of this agreement ('Agreement'). </p>

<p><b>Position: </b></p>

<p>You will work as a [EMPLOYEE_JOB] for the Company (the position is home based). Your responsibilities, to which you will devote your fulltime efforts, will include the items pursuant to the General Job Description and such other responsibilities that may be assigned to you by the Company. The Company may change your responsibilities at any time during your employment by creating new responsibilities and/or removing certain responsibilities. </p>

<p><b>Compensation: </b></p>

<p>The probationary period is four weeks. The probationary period (30 days) begins from the date when the first package is delivered to your postal address. It will be a paid probationary period, but the only payment frequency supported during the trial is piecework. It means you will receive $20 for each package processed during the trial. Once the trial ends you will receive an opportunity to earn $500 weekly and $25 per each task processed. You will be given some additional offers from the Company to increase your income through the trial. Full Process tasks for the clients, for example, are paid on a percentage basis. More details about Full Process tasks requirements and procedures will be provided upon request. </p>

<p><b>Benefits: </b></p>

<p>You may participate in the Company's group health plan, with 100% of the premium paid by the Company. The plan is offered through top management and its choice of carriers. Either the Company or top management may change, educe or terminate such employee benefits at any time. </p>
